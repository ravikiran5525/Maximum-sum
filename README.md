Sliding Window Algorithm: Maximum Subarray Sum (Length K)

This repository contains an optimized Java solution for finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of a fixed length, `k`.

Approach

The code uses the **"Sliding Window"** pattern to solve the problem efficiently.

*   Time Complexity: O(N) — This is much faster than a brute-force approach because it only requires a single pass through the data.
*   Space Complexity: O(1)

How to Run

1.  Save the code as `Main.java`.
2.  Compile using `javac Main.java` in your terminal.
3.  Run using `java Main`.

The program will prompt you to enter the array size, the array elements, and the value for `k`.

Example

Input: `[1, 4, 2, 10, 2]` with `k=3`

Output: `Maximum sum of k consequtive numbers is: 16`
